# Fake Api Server

- This is a Fake-api-server, It serves you some fake data like todos, usernames etc. Which you can use while learning development at times when you have to fetch data from backend. 
- The backend server is written in `Hono` ( cloudlfare workers ). It is hosted on the url listed on top right corner of the repository.
- If you have any advancements to add into it. Feel free to fork the repo create your branch and raise a pull request. 

- Well, This is not a competetor to any one of the existing servers on web which servers the same data. We just build it for our personal use. Most of the we don't get the data in the required format so we built in a way that serves us the best. 
- Feel free to mention any of your requirements we will add it. 

# Happy Coding ðŸ™‚
